## Features

### Customizable Architecture

**Unleash Your Creativity**: With LLM Builder, you're not bound by a fixed architecture. You can craft your own language model architecture, tailored precisely to your research objectives. Whether you're looking to build a massive model with thousands of layers or a more compact one for efficiency, you can easily plug the pre-defined modules or your own custom module in your LLM Architecture and bring your ideas to life.

**Transformative Model Configurations**: Experiment with different model configurations, from transformer-based architectures to hybrid models that combine various components by either using pre-defined architecture or your own architecture. You can also contribute your custom module and architecture for other to use. Customize the number of layers, attention mechanisms, and embedding layers to suit your specific research needs.

### Effortless Dataset Preparation

**Data Made Manageable**: Preparing a robust dataset is often a daunting task. LLM Builder simplifies the process, providing you with the simple and straightforward `PrepareDataset` class, to clean, preprocess, train tokenizer and prepare your dataset seamlessly and parallely. Our library allows you to focus on the quality of your data, rather than the complexities of data handling.

**Dataset Transformation**: Easily convert your raw data into the format required to pre-train your Large Language Model. LLM Builder handles everything, from text tokenization to creating data pipelines (data iterators and loaders) with prefetch for efficient training.

### Versatile Training Optimization

**Fine-Tune for Excellence**: Achieving optimal results often involves extensive fine-tuning. LLM Builder streamlines this process, offering a range of training optimization techniques. Whether you need to improve the model's accuracy, reduce training time, or optimize hyperparameters, our platform provides the necessary tools and guidance.

**Adaptive Training Strategies**: Experiment with various training strategies such as learning rate schedules, gradient clipping, and distributed training. Our platform adapts to your requirements, allowing you to achieve the best possible model performance.

### Multi-Device Training

**Flexible Hardware Support**: LLM Builder is equipped to handle training on a variety of hardware configurations. Whether you have a single CPU, GPU, TPU host, or TPU core at your disposal, or you need to orchestrate training across multiple GPUs and TPU hosts, our platform seamlessly accommodates diverse hardware environments.

**Efficient Scaling**: Utilize the power of distributed training on multi-GPU setups and TPU clusters to train your models efficiently. LLM Builder simplifies the process of scaling your training across multiple devices, enabling you to take full advantage of your hardware resources.

### Comprehensive Logging

**In-Depth Insights**: LLM Builder is more than just a training tool; it's a companion that meticulously logs every aspect of your model development. Keep a detailed record of training progress, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics for easy analysis and optimization.

**Enhanced Model Understanding**: Gain a deeper understanding of your model's performance by visualizing training statistics and loss curves. Our platform equips you with the insights needed to make informed decisions throughout the training process.

Embrace the power of LLM Builder's features to simplify, optimize, and elevate your Large Language Model projects. It's your gateway to creating state-of-the-art language models with confidence and precision.
