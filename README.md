## Introduction

Welcome to LLM Builder, your one-stop solution for easily constructing robust Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch. This repository simplifies the entire process, from preparing datasets and customizing architecture to multi-device training and optimization.

[Include a brief introduction to your project, its goals, and why it's valuable.]

## Features

- **Dataset Preparation:** Streamline the process of acquiring, cleaning, and preprocessing data for your LLM.
- **Customizable Architecture:** Tailor your LLM's architecture to meet your specific requirements.
- **Multi-Device Training:** Optimize your training across multiple devices for improved performance.
- **Training Optimization:** Fine-tune your model for better results and efficiency.

[Provide a list of key features and capabilities of your project.]
