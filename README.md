## Introduction

LLM Builder is an open-source deep learning training library specifically for building Large Language Models (LLMs) by [Faheem](https://github.com/TheFaheem). where the intricacies of crafting formidable Large Language Models (LLMs) are masterfully tamed, rendering the formidable accessible. Our repository empowers users, from fledgling enthusiasts to seasoned researchers, to embark on a journey of LLM construction without the burden of extensive code wrangling.

At its core, LLM Builder stands as an all-encompassing solution, artfully handling every facet of the LLM creation process. With a customizable architecture as your canvas, this platform eases the labyrinthine path of dataset preparation, paving the way for a smoother transition to the training optimization phase. It meticulously logs your progress, ensuring that no insights are lost in the labyrinth of machine learning. 

Liberated from hardware constraints, LLM Builder extends its embrace to the entire spectrum of training environments, encompassing single GPUs, TPU hosts, TPU cores, and the orchestration of multi-GPU and TPU devices.
