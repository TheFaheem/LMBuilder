## Introduction

LLM Builder is an open-source deep learning training library specifically for building Large Language Models (LLMs) by [Faheem](https://github.com/TheFaheem). A visionary library designed to make the complex and often formidable task of building and training Large Language Models (LLMs) accessible to all, from fledgling enthusiasts to seasoned researchers. It have painstakingly removed the barriers of intricate code work, enabling a streamlined journey towards LLM construction without the burden of extensive code wrangling.

Our repository empowers users to harness the potential of state-of-the-art language models without the need for extensive technical expertise. At its core, **LLM Builder** stands as an all-encompassing solution, encapsulating every facet of the LLM development process, spanning from architecting customizable model structures, handling dataset preparation to paving the way for a smoother transition to the training optimization phase, and meticulous logging, allowing you to focus on the big picture of your research.

Liberated from hardware constraints, LLM Builder extends its embrace to the entire spectrum of training environments, encompassing single GPUs, TPU hosts, TPU cores, and the orchestration of multi-GPU and TPU devices.




## Features

- **Customizable Architecture:** Tailor your LLM's architecture to meet your specific requirements or you can use predefined architectures
- **Dataset Preparation:** Streamline the process of acquiring, cleaning, and preprocessing data to pretrain your LLM.
- **Multi-Device Training:** Optimize your training across multiple devices for improved performance.
- **Training Optimization:** Fine-tune your model for better results and efficiency.
